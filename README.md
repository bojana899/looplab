Because CSS Grid and Flexbox work well together, it’s highly recommended that web developers capitalize on using them as a tandem in designing a website with responsive design. For instance, in the matter of layouts, you can use Flexbox to make the basic layout of your site (navigation, images, column layouts, etc.) Afterward, you can rely on CSS Grid to essentially perform enhancements to the said layout. CSS Grid, for example, can be used to make the designs of elements such as photo galleries to be more responsive. Of course, this is but one example out of many.

You can also use it to develop a grid layout, for instance, then utilize media queries to fill the said grid with pertinent content. With the advantage of CSS Grid, you won’t have to worry about the content not being rendered properly for the specific device or screen that the visitor would be using. If you want to make sure that they the content of each grid is properly arranged, you can use Flexbox to ensure this.

This is but one solid proof of how well these two work together in helping you develop a web property that would always have responsive design. It isn’t at all surprising that Flexbox and CSS Grid are able to do this as both were created in a time when responsive design is nothing short of vital.
